# Breakthrough

> **Breakthorugh** is a clever abstract game invented by Dan Troyka in 2000. In **Breakthorugh**, two uniform armies confront each other on a checkerboard and start a merciless battle, capturing enemies and advancing ranks as the game progresses. Retreating is not even an option in this game, and the final victory will be for the first player who breaks through the enemy defenses.

> This document provides an overview of the game rules and their tactical implications as well as some basic hints on **Breakthorugh** strategy.
